Ninji's Quick and Dirty Paste Script
====================================

I needed a simple pastebin, and I didn't feel like writing PHP or figuring out
how to deploy Python web code, so I figured... well, I don't *need* a web
service, right?

This script takes a file with content to paste and generates pretty HTML using
Pygments, and then uploads it somewhere and spits out a URL.

It currently writes to a local file or uses scp to upload - depending on the
system it's running on - but you can (and should) change this by modifying the
`upload()` function inside `paste.py`. Runs on both Python 2.x and 3.x.

Usage
-----

Syntax: `python paste.py <language> <path-to-file>`

Example command line: `python paste.py python paste.py`

Language is a standard Pygments short lexer name - the only exception is `irc`,
which bypasses Pygments entirely and uses a custom log munger I wrote,
located inside `irc_highlight.py`.

Stylesheets
-----------

`gencss.py` outputs CSS to stdout containing the styles used by Pygments's
highlighted output, and a bunch of other things. The generated HTML loads this
from `res/style.css` by default.

Output Data
-----------

Paste names generated by this script include a timestamp and 8 random
alphanumeric characters, for example: `140221.204843.krigifbd`

A copy of the original paste data is also output into a file with the
same name in the `raw` directory.
